🧠 Natural Language Processing (NLP) Project with Tokenization, Lemmatization, Stemming, NER & NLG
This project provides a hands-on implementation of key Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques using pure Python or lightweight libraries. It focuses on the following components:

🔹 Tokenization
Splits raw text into individual words, phrases, or tokens.
Useful for downstream tasks like analysis, tagging, and generation.
Example:
Input: "NLP is fun to learn!"
Output: ['NLP', 'is', 'fun', 'to', 'learn', '!']

🔹 Lemmatization
Reduces words to their base or dictionary form (lemma).
Ensures that variations of a word are treated as the same concept.
Example:
Input: "running, runs, ran"
Output: run, run, run

🔹 Stemming
Trims words down to their root form by removing suffixes.
A faster but less accurate alternative to lemmatization.
Example:
Input: "playing, played, player"
Output: play, play, play

🏷️ Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Identifies and extracts key entities such as people, locations, dates, and organizations from plain text.
Helps in transforming raw text into structured, machine-readable information.
Implemented without external frameworks using basic NLP techniques and rule-based patterns.

Example:
Input: "John visited Microsoft headquarters in Seattle last Tuesday."
Output:
John → PERSON
Microsoft → ORGANIZATION
Seattle → LOCATION
Tuesday → DATE
✍️ Natural Language Generation (NLG)
Generates human-like text outputs based on input, templates, or logic.
Can be used for:
Text rephrasing
Automated message generation
Simple content synthesis
Focuses on programmatic generation using string manipulation, conditional logic, and formatting techniques.
Example:
Input Data:
Name: John
Action: Visited
Place: Microsoft HQ
Date: Tuesday
Output: "John visited Microsoft headquarters on Tuesday."
