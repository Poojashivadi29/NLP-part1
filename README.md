🏷️ Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Identifies and extracts key entities such as people, locations, dates, and organizations from plain text.
Helps in transforming raw text into structured, machine-readable information.
Implemented without external frameworks using basic NLP techniques and rule-based patterns.

Example:
Input: "John visited Microsoft headquarters in Seattle last Tuesday."
Output:
John → PERSON
Microsoft → ORGANIZATION
Seattle → LOCATION
Tuesday → DATE
✍️ Natural Language Generation (NLG)
Generates human-like text outputs based on input, templates, or logic.
Can be used for:
Text rephrasing
Automated message generation
Simple content synthesis
Focuses on programmatic generation using string manipulation, conditional logic, and formatting techniques.
Example:
Input Data:
Name: John
Action: Visited
Place: Microsoft HQ
Date: Tuesday
Output: "John visited Microsoft headquarters on Tuesday."
